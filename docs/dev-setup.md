# development environment setup

Here are some notes that might help with setting up your development environment while working on Note Splitter.

## dependencies

After cloning the repo, you will need to use a few commands to get started:

* I highly recommend creating a virtual environment first.
* `pip install -e .` to locally install Note Splitter and its dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
* `pip install -r .\requirements_dev.txt` to install the dependencies for development.
* `pre-commit install` to set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) git hook scripts

**when the dependencies change**

* Update the appropriate requirements file (and use its corresponding command again if a dependency was added).
* If the new dependency is for Note Splitter itself and not just a development dependency, add it to docs/environment.yaml.

## launch.json

If you use launch.json files to keep track of how to run programs, below is an example for this project that I use with VS Code. Most/all of it should be automatically generated by your IDE, but maybe the "name" and/or "program" fields will require an adjustment.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: main.py (Integrated Terminal)",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/note_splitter/main.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

## directory structure

Here are descriptions of what each of Note Splitter's folders are for:

```
.
├───.github             # Files to configure GitHub.
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE  # Issue templates.
│   └── workflows       # GitHub Actions configuration files for automated testing.
├── docs                # Files for documentation (.md and .rst) and for configuration.
│   └── images          # Images used in the documentation and/or the README.
├── note_splitter       # Source code for Note Splitter.
└── tests               # Automated tests.
    └── assets          # Files used in automated and manual tests.
```

## automated testing

To locally run the automated tests for Note Splitter, there are a few commands you can use:
* `pytest` to run the tests in your current environment
* `tox` if you want to run the tests in multiple virtual environments (this also runs in GitHub Actions after each push)
* `pre-commit run --all-files` if you want to run all the pre-commit git hook scripts without committing, but please discard removal of trailing whitespace to sample_markdown.md
* `pre-commit run hook-id-here --file note_splitter/file-name-here.py` if you want to run one pre-commit git hook script on one file without committing
