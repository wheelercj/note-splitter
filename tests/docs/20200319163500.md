# The Zettelkasten Method
#writing #notetaking #learning #research #zettelkasten

"Zettelkasten" is German for "index card box". The Zettelkasten Method of note-taking is a way to connect ideas to each other in the same way the human mind does. Using wiki-style links and tags, this method helps you explore the network of your ideas, find new connections, and see things from different perspectives. Specific notes are easy to find even if you have thousands of them all in the same folder. The Zettelkasten Method is great for students, researchers, novelists, journalists, and anyone trying to learn or write about complicated topics. Of all the software that supports this method, you'll probably want to use either [Zettlr](zettlr.com/), [Bear](https://bear.app/#pricing), or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
